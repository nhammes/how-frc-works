# What are Awards?
FIRST has defined a set of Awards, most of which are handed out by a group of volunteer Judges at each official competition to recognize the efforts of participants. Not only is assigning these awards the work of a pretty sizable group of volunteers, but awards are a critical component of the 'R' in FIRST, a key piece of their recognition strategy. So they must be pretty important.

So what is an award? From one perspective, an award is the criteria used to assess teams in a particular category. In another, an award is the trophy, plaque, medal, and/or blue banner that winners receive. From yet another, an award is the recognition of a milestone, the fact of an achievement. 

There are a few key categories of award to understand:
* Team Awards
  * Team Attributes
  * Machine, Creativity, & Innovation Awards 
  * Robot Performance Awards
* Individual Awards

Most awards are given to a single team, like the Team Spirit award, but some awards are given to an individual team member or volunteer, like the Woodie Flowers Finalist Award. The judges hand out Machine awards, focused primarily on the team's robot, and Team Attributes awards, focused on other aspects of the recipient team. Teams who are on the finalist or winning alliance at an event earn a Robot Performance award corresponding to their performance on the field.
## Why are awards?
Now there's one additional perspective on what awards are that is critical in understanding them; in some sense, an award is actually a set of incentives, a method of FIRST communicating something they find to be important to teams, and encouraging them to do it, and to compete for limited copies of the award available to them.

So what does FIRST want? They want teams to do cool and exciting things with robots, to learn engineering skills, the business skills to build a more sustainable program, and to create even more teams to follow the same path.
## Why should you want one?
Yes, awards can positively affect a team's ability to advance, especially if that team is competing in a district. Beyond just advancement, I see two key reasons:
1. Recognition of efforts
2. Sharing of accomplishments

On the recognition front, the award criteria are fairly straightforward, but the ways in which a team can embody them are not. Consequently, there are many teams trying many different ways to earn many different awards, and earning any of them is a hard thing to do. Year-to-year, sometimes teams find renewed passion to pursue an award, or focus their limited efforts somewhere else. The other teams at a competition are serious competitors; they make winning an award a thing that is hard. And that feeling of successfully doing something hard should feel like a great accomplishment in and of itself, because it is.

Conversely, there are people outside of your team, outside of FIRST, who see great things happening, but don't have a good sense of the scale or scope of accomplishment. Or maybe it isn't clear to them the purpose of your team's activities. FIRST gives teams trophies, plaques, and other physical items that symbolize teams' accomplishment. Principals, sponsors, classmates, or school districts may not understand what it means that your team won a Gracious Professionalism award, but a trophy placed in a trophy case speaks a more universal language. A key sponsor may even appreciate a plaque or medal to celebrate your team's accomplishment, and to symbolize their role in it.
# How they work
FIRST recruits volunteer Judges to talk to teams, and assess them against the various award criteria. The Judges on-site at an event are responsible for all awards presented there except Winner and Finalist, Volunteer of the Year, and the Woodie Flowers Finalist award. The Judges are lead by a Judge Advisor, who may be helped by a Judge Assistant (or two).

Judges may assign up to a single award per team at an event, and are instructed to give each team the award they most deserve.
## Criteria
Each award has a set of criteria that are made available to both teams and judges, by which judges assess each team against. As an example, let's use the Team Spirit Award:
- Spirit is consistent both throughout the team and also throughout the contest in attitude, appearance, originality, and depth.
- The team displays obvious enthusiasm – in supporting teams, appearance, interactions with teams/Judges, etc. – at the competition.
- Spirit is part of the team and is apparent in all they do, including at their school, in their community, with sponsors and other teams, etc.
- They demonstrate spirit as a unified team.

Note that while these criteria are written to be clear and understandable, they are not written to be objective, or unambiguous. While this fact does, in some ways, make judges' and teams' jobs harder, I think there are three good reasons it works this way:
 1. The role of a judge would be much less interesting if awards were simply measuring teams and robots against an objective standard, rather than assessing subtler differences. FIRST wants returning volunteers, potential/current sponsors as judges, and making it less interesting isn't good for anybody
 2. Because award criteria are a method of communicating what FIRST wants teams to do, they're focused on the effects of what teams do, rather than the actions they want teams to take to get there. With thousands of teams in dozens of countries, the right way to best achieve FIRST's goals in a team's community vary widely across teams, over time. FIRST can better empower teams to achieve their goals by creating a blueprint for what to do, than an instruction manual for how to do it.
 3. Creativity breeds innovation. Thousands of teams have so many more hours to think of clever and creative ways to achieve something than the subset of FIRST's small staff who works on awards has. And the process of engaging critically with their community, their actions, and their goals itself has a powerful impact on those team members. By telling teams how to do things, so much opportunity for innovation would be lost.

## Process
When the Judges show up at a competition, they meet together, where the Judge Advisor walks them through the process and goals of judging, and gives them some tips and tricks on how to judge well. At a high level:
- The Impact and Dean's List judges read submissions in advance, interview all contenders, then deliberate on decisions.
- Other judges are assigned to team or machine awards, grouped off, usually in pairs, but sometimes in groups of three, to some group of teams, for some group of awards.
	- How exactly this happens can vary based on the size of an event, the Judge Advisor, the guidance they're given that year, and possibly other factors. Understanding it more precisely also is generally not helpful to teams
	- These judges will rank the teams they saw in terms of each award they assessed separately
- At that point, the judges come together and deliberate, building a single list for each award, and assigning awards to teams. If a team is on top of multiple award lists, the judges need to figure out which singular award to give that team.
- Once award winners are determined, the judges write a script for each team award they're handing out.

Note that the schedule for when these things happen varies dramatically between different types of events, and somewhat between similar events.

Once scripts are done, the judges typically come to the field, where they have seating set aside, to watch remaining playoff matches and hand out awards to teams. 
## Scripts
I personally love scripts. They're fun. But more than that, scripts are one of the few means of feedback available from the judges, to teams. Judges explicitly write scripts with the intent to explain to everyone why that team won, but they also write them to be fun, and reflect the team from their perspective.

This means that the award scripts tell you how the Judges saw you. The things you said that were most memorable, most convincing, and best fit the award you received are generally called out. Now there are some imperfections, and some scripts won't say much, or it may be hard to ascertain what is intended. One piece of feedback may or may not give a clear picture of how Judges are reading your team, but the trend across multiple events should be strong.

Also, this isn't as widely-known as I would hope, but scripts are available after the event in the [frc-events](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/) tool, to the public. As an example, see the awards page for the [2024 Central Valley Regional](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2024/CAFR/awards). You might use this to check scripts that you may not have heard every word of for an event, or as part of your competition analysis to look at awards teams you're competing with won the previous season. Note that the system that stores scripts is relatively new, and data gets less complete the further back you go pretty quickly. Most events in 2024 have most award scripts, and I expect this to be true going forward.

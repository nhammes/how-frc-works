# What are Awards?
FIRST has defined a set of Awards which are handed out by a group of volunteer Judges at each official competition to recognize the efforts of participants. Not only is assigning these awards the work of a pretty sizable group of volunteers, but awards are a critical component of the 'R' in FIRST, a key piece of their recognition strategy.

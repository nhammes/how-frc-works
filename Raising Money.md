There are three categories of methods to raise money for a FIRST team:
* Sponsorships
* Grant Writing
* Fundraisers

Broadly speaking, Sponsorships involve an ongoing relationship with some entity that has money, whether a company, a private foundation, an individual, or some other such entity.  Grant Writing is the art of submitting applications for funds to entities who have offered them for some purpose, usually at some reasonable level of scale. Fundraisers are a broad category of action where you have some event or drive, where you provide something of value to people, in exchange for more money than the value you provided them.
# Sponsorships
Sponsors are the financial backbone of a sustainable team, and most sustainable nonprofit ventures in the world at large. Sponsorships are first and foremost a relationship with some entity who provides your team with resources regularly, usually annually. There are two primary types of sponsorship, Cash, and In-Kind. Cash sponsorships are, as one may expect, someone writing your team a check. In-Kind sponsorships involve the sponsor providing goods or services rather than cash. Some sponsors will offer some mix of in-kind and cash donations, where the total value of the sponsorship is the sum of these two components' value.

There is no one size fits all solution to managing sponsors. Each sponsor has different needs, wants, goals, and will respond well to different strategies. The art of maintaining a sponsor relationship is a balancing act of customizing your approach to sponsor relationships while putting in an amount of effort that meets your team's needs. To do this effectively, you need to build structure around what your team offers sponsors. Most common strategies end up resembling sponsor tiers.
## Sponsor tiers
### What do you offer
Essentially, a list of sponsor tiers is a communication tool to current and potential sponsors, to set their expectations about what you'll do if they provide a certain amount of value to your team. To build and maintain a sponsor list, you should think about what value your team can offer to your sponsors, often in terms of marketing, showing the impact of their support, artifacts they can display, or employee engagement, but the sky really is the limit here. To provide a few examples:

* Putting their name/logo on your robot or t-shirt
* Placement in official sponsor list/team name read at competitions
* Framed team photos
* Hand-written thank you notes
* Team newsletters
* Information about your team's impact

These methods of providing value to your sponsors have different amounts of value to different sponsors, and should be ordered such that those that tend to be more valuable for the sponsors you have correspond to larger values, to create an incentive structure for those sponsors to increase the level of their support. They should also be customized, as some sponsors may not want the frequency of communication a newsletter entails, may prefer to remain anonymous, etc.
### Tiering
#### Strategy
In order to build a list of tiers, you first must consider the range of sponsorship values your team wishes to have. In principle, your highest sponsorship could be up to your entire budget, but if something happens with that relationship, you've just lost your entire budget. To avoid this existential risk, you should seek to have a diverse pool of sponsors, some larger, some smaller, and some in the middle. If you're able to nurture those relationships well, some of those smaller sponsorships will grow with your program, and your tiers will measure this.

The fundamental question here is what a big sponsor is to your program, what a small sponsor is, and where the natural breakpoints between those live. Most teams have 3-5 levels, with two "medium" sized steps.
#### Picking Values
You should pick numbers for your ranges that are memorable and easy to communicate, "Anyone who gives us at least $250 gets a team t-shirt" is a simple message that might resonate with smaller sponsors. For larger sponsors, that might look like "For $1000 you get your logo on the robot, for $2500, the logo is in full color". In general, nice round numbers like $100, $1,000, $10,000 are great choices, and simple fractions thereof ($250, $500, $3000, etc.) Using your team number is also a popular choice, especially for teams with numbers between 1000 and 5000, near already-good numbers.
#### Branding
The other key consideration is branding. You want your tiers to be simple, memorable, and useful, and while well-selected ranges can meet those criteria, branding the tiers as a whole can make them more impactful on every dimension. The classic example is precious metals, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, with Copper, Bronze or Diamond sometimes used among other options for additional tiers. In the cultural context (USA) most teams inhabit, how these tiers are ordered is natural and intuitive for most potential sponsors.

While precious metals are the classic choice because they work well, there are plenty of other strong choices teams make, that work well for them. To provide some examples:
* Descriptors of the impact of donations (Sustaining, Supporting, Key)
* Descriptors of the depth of relationship (Friend, Partner, Supporter, Advocate)
* Tiers based on team brand ([2910](https://frcteam2910.org/fundraising/), [6956](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ffBeHaKky1uDXfdl_CWIXMxBVie5L9vR/view))

#### Putting it all together
Let's consider an example of a hypothetical team with the number 9989 called Blizzard Robotics. They have a budget of $45,000, and get 2/3 of that each year from sponsors, with a few really large local corporate sponsors, and a lot of parents and local businesses giving a few hundred dollars each. They're focusing on growing that middle section of sponsors.
| Tier Amount | Tier Name | Tier Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $100+  | Cold Front | Receive quarterly newsletter and annual impact report, name on website list of sponsors |
| $500+ | Flurry | Hand-written thank you, invitation to annual sponsor mixer and robot reveal events |
| $1000+ | Squall | Name or logo on robot and team t-shirt, receive two team t-shirts per year |
| $2500+ | Snowstorm |  A medal each time we earn them at competition, framed team photo each year |
| $5000+ | Permafrost | A demo, lunch & learn, or FRC tech talk at your business within 100mi of our school each year |

## Timing
When managing relationships with sponsors, particularly when you make promises in your sponsor tiers with a time component, it's important to be on top of things, and consistent. To this end, it's very important to have a plan that you actively use and iterate on as needs evolve. The constraints that shape your plan vary from team to team, and from sponsor to sponsor, and will change over the course of a team's relationship with an individual sponsor. There are some broad trends that may be helpful in shaping the constraints you plan around:

* It's easier to get a robot to a sponsor demo event during the build season
* Larger corporate sponsors tend to have a Corporate Social Responsibility person (or even, department) whose job it is to sponsor groups like FIRST teams, and they may have relationships with dozens of teams, who all want to communicate with them with some regularity
	* They probably have an annual outreach budget, and being able to demonstrate impact to their leadership may allow them to increase that budget. This demonstration might happen through an on-site event, or perhaps through quantitative reports showing what the money funded, but there's likely some ideal time of year on their side.
* Smaller companies and individual sponsorships will naturally have less indirection between your contact and the person who decides how much money to spend, who might even be the same person. 
	* You might try inviting the decision-maker to one of your competitions to witness FIRST in-person. People who can allocate more money tend to have more complex schedules, so getting the invitation out there early is important, and you may need to follow up closer to the event. This can be a powerful technique for nurturing and growing relationships, since they get to see qualitatively what effect their funding has on your team.
		* Depending on your sponsor's relationship with FIRST, interest in the program beyond your team, you may consider reaching out to event leadership for your competition about VIP/sponsor relations activities at your competition. There might not be anything available for team sponsors, but it's worth asking.
	* Even if the sponsor is quantitatively driven, it's important not to forget the human element; robots, FIRST events, and all the goings-on within a team are very interesting and impressive to people who aren't accustomed and deeply familiar with them. Make sure your updates, offers, and interactions have a personal touch, especially if the sponsor is deeply-invested in your team, or you're trying to deepen that investment.
* It's a better use of your time in the short-term to personalize interactions more with sponsors who give more, but long-term, a personal touch with smaller sponsors can be an effective way to grow those relationships. The ideal strategy tends to be a balance between optimizing for these two goals.

### Example Schedule


## Other thoughts
Some teams also consider that individual and corporate sponsors in their area have different enough scales of budgets, and different enough needs to have two different scales, and sets of rewards. This does add complexity, and can double the number of things you need to think about in recognizing sponsors. If you have a large number of individual sponsors, this may be worth consideration.

Some teams offer special Sponsor Recognitions, or Sponsor Awards to thank sponsors who go above and beyond, or step up in some big way. This makes sense for teams with a lot of sponsors and a growing program, but may not be as useful for teams with fewer sponsors, or who aren't actively growing those relationships. I view this as a sign of a reasonably mature program, since you've not only built deep relationships with sponsors to the point they go above and beyond, but your focus is on cultivating rather than building.

# Fundraisers
Any time you're organizing activities for your team that bring in more money than they cost is a fundraiser. This can be the most fun way for a team to raise money, because of the sheer design space available, but can also be the least fun if you put a lot of work into an event and end up with little to show for it. Some fundraisers are events, others are activities spread out over a longer period of time.
